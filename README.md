Project Overview

This project demonstrates the following Pandas operations:

    Data cleaning and handling missing values.

    Aggregating data, performing group-by operations.

    Merging and joining multiple datasets.

    Data filtering and sorting.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

    Simple data transformations and reshaping.

The project uses real-world datasets to explore and apply these concepts.
Technologies Used
